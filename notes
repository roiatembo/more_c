notes on the c language

The Preprocessor
it allows the programs to be easier to read and modify and port

its part of the c compilation process, it analyzes statements before the code

they can be on top of the source code or anywhere in your code and they are led by the # symbol

in the process it can create constants and macros
conditional statements can also be put in the preprocessor

<stdio.h> the dot h is header file, this one comes with the c program and displays some funcionality like printf
stdio = standard input output
header files provide some information about the source code
you can write your own header files 

Two ways to #include header files in program
using angle brackets <> tells the preprocessor to look for the file in one or more standard system directories

using double quotes tells the preprocessor to firest look in the current directory

if not defined is used to protect the preprocessor from including files more than once

Three rules about the scanf functions
returns the number of items that is successfully reads
if you use scanf to read a value for one of the basic variable types weve discussed, preced the variable name with a &
if you use scanf to read a string into a character array dont use an &
